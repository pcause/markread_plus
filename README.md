markread_plus
=============

Enhanced version of the mark read command for tt-rss

This plugin allows you to specify a number and itnerval for a mark read
command on the selected label/feed/category.  You can select the
itnerval to be either hours/days/weeks/months.  For example, you
can now have mark read 3 days or 48 hours.


To use: create a directory in your plugins directory and put the files
there.  This plugin needs to be a system plugin, so add to
your config.php.

Once enabled it will add an item to the actions menu for
"Enhanced Mark Read".  Select this and you'll get a popup
that allows you to specify both a number and interval (hours/days/weeks/months)
for the mark read of the selected label/category/feed.
